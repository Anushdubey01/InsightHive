## Usage
This section outlines how to run the various components of the platform.

### ETL Process
1. **Extract Data:**
   - Use the `extract.py` script to extract data from your source systems (e.g., SQL Server, MongoDB).
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     python src/etl/extract.py
     ```

2. **Transform Data:**
   - Run the `transform.py` script to process and clean the extracted data.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     python src/etl/transform.py
     ```

3. **Load Data:**
   - Finally, load the transformed data into the Azure SQL Database using the `load.py` script.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     python src/etl/load.py
     ```

### Big Data Processing
To run big data processing tasks using Spark:
1. Launch your Spark job using the `process_data.py` script in the `big_data` directory.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     python src/big_data/process_data.py
     ```

### Data Visualization
To create dashboards or visualizations:
1. Use the `create_dashboard.py` script to connect to your processed data and generate visual insights.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     python src/visualization/create_dashboard.py
     ```

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Open the `example_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter to explore the data and generate insights interactively.
